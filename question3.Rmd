It is an chance for you to practice your skills on regular expressions.


(a) Consider the `phones.txt` files, extract all the telephone/fax numbers. (Hint: there should be 24 of them.)



(b) Consider the `names.txt` files, extract all the names by splitting each line.



(c) Consider the course description page https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/courses/descriptions-undergrad
    Extract the course numbers and titles from the url and create a table with columns `course` and `title`.
